        <h1>Terms of services</h1>
        <p>Last updated: February 1, 2022

ArchiVerse (ARKVRS) is a collection of digital architectural artwork running on the Ethereum network. This website is owned and operated by ARKVRS. The following terms and conditions constitute a legally binding agreement (the “Agreement”) between you (also referred to herein as “You”, “Your” or “User”) and ARKVRS ( “we” or “us”). 
        </p>
        
        <h4>1. Definition</h4>
        <p>“Art” means any art, graphics, images, designs, logos, taglines, and drawings that may be associated with an NFT in which you acquire Licensed Rights. 

“ARKVRS” means ArchiVerse 

“Name and Likeness” means name, nicknames, images, likenesses, marks, copyrights, trade dress colors, trade dress designs, and/or all other intellectual property of ARKVRS.  

"NFT" means any blockchain-tracked, non-fungible token. 

“Licensed Rights” with respect to an NFT means your rights to a Licensed NFT of which you are the current rightful licensee and which you acquired from a legitimate source, where proof of such purchase is recorded on the relevant blockchain. 

“Licensed NFT” means an NFT from ARKVRS.
        </p>
        <h4>2. Ownership</h4>
        <p><b>I. Your ownership:</b> When you purchase the Licensed NFT, the ownership is transferred to you on the Ethereum blockchain for that individual piece of digital artwork, a combination of traits and number. Ownership of the NFT is ruled by the smart contract and the Ethereum Network terms. We, ARKVRS, have no ability to alter, freeze, seize or modify the ownership of any ARKVRS NFT.

<b>II. Personal use:</b> Subject to your continued compliance with these terms, ARKVRS grants you a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art, along with any extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes: i) for your own personal, non-commercial usage; ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your ARKVRS NFT, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each ARKVRS owner’s rights to display the Art and ensures that only the actual owner can display the Art; or iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your ARKVRS artwork, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each ARKVRS owner’s rights to display the Art and ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the artwrok is no longer visible once the owner of the ARKVRS artwork leaves the website/application.

<b>III. Commercial use:</b> Subject to your continued compliance with these terms, ARKVRS grants you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the Art (“Commercial Use”). Examples of such Commercial Use includes the use of the Art to produce and sell merchandise products, displaying copies of the artwork. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of ARKVRS artwork generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each ARKVRS owner’s rights to display the Art and ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of ARKVRS generally, provided that the third party website or application cryptographically verifies each ARKVRS owner’s rights to display the Art and ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the purchased ARKVRS artwork leaves the website/application; or iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing. You cannot use the Art in connection with images of hatred, violence or any other inappropriate behavior. The License granted in above only applies to the extent that you continue to own the relevant NFT. If at any time you trade, donate, giveaway, transfer or otherwise dispose of your NFT for any reason, the license granted above will immediately expire, without notice, and you will have no further right in or to the Art of this NFT.

All purchases of Licensed NFTs, as well as associated charges, are non-refundable. This no-refund policy shall apply at all times regardless of your decision to terminate usage of the Licensed NFT, any disruption to the operations of any components of the Licensed NFT, or any other reason whatsoever.</p>
        <h4>3. ARKVRS IP</h4>
        <p>Other than the rights to the Art, nothing gives you any rights to any other trademarks or other intellectual property rights belonging to ARKVRS including, without limitation ARKVRS and associated logos. All of these rights are expressly reserved in the name of ARKVRS.</p>
        <h4>4. Safety</h4>
        <p>Users are entirely responsible for the safety and management of their own private Ethereum wallets and validating all transactions and contracts generated by this website before approval. Furthermore, as the ARKVRS smart contract runs on the Ethereum network, there is no ability to undo, reverse, or restore any transactions.</p>
        <h4>5. Feedback</h4>
        <p>You can submit comments, bug reports, ideas about the site or the project. By submitting any feedback, you agree that we are free to use them in any way we choose without additional compensation to you and you hereby grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive worldwide license to incorporate and use the feedback for any purpose.</p>
